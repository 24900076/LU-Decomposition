# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm

## Input:
import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import lu
A=np.array(eval(input()))
p,l,u=lu(A)
print(l)
print(u)
